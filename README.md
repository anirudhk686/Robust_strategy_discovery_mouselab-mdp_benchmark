# Robust_strategy_discovery_mouselab_benchmark

This repository contains the code for generating the benchmark environments for Robust strategy discovery in a 333 environment setup in mouselab mdp paradigm. The details of the environment structure is explained in our CogSci paper(published in 2020, link soon to be updated).

This code helps to generate train and test environments as per the prior and likelihoods explained in our paper. Environments are of the mouselab-mdp type [Mouselab-MDP: A new paradigm for tracing how people plan](https://osf.io/7wcya). They are gym environments and hence suitable for RL algorithms.
